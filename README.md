# Homelab

This project is 100% based on the work from @onedr0p's [cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template), but back when it was still [k3s](https://k3s.io) base.

It runs on a single old iMac that is now running Ubuntu 24.04. If I ever purchase more infrastructure I'd like explore [Talos Linux](https://github.com/siderolabs/talos). But for now, this works.... most day!

Like the template, my cluster is driven by Ansible, Flux, Renovate, and GitHub Actions.
